# Kanji View Implementation - Status Report

## ✅ Completed Implementation

The Kanji view has been fully implemented with the following features:

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **KanjiDisplayModel**: Created a unified data model that combines `Kanji` and `KanjiProgress` data for seamless binding
- **Dependency Injection**: Implemented proper DI pattern with both parameterless constructor (design-time) and injected constructor (runtime)
- **MVVM Pattern**: Full implementation following the established pattern from DashboardView

### 📊 Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Kanji Count**: Displays total number of kanji in selected JLPT level
- **Learned Count**: Shows kanji with SRS level > 2 (considered learned)
- **Review Due Count**: Displays kanji that need review today
- **Study Streak**: Shows user's current study streak

### 🎯 Features Implemented

#### 1. JLPT Level Filtering
- Dropdown filter for N5, N4, N3, N2, N1 levels
- Automatically loads kanji for selected level
- Real-time filtering updates

#### 2. Search Functionality
- Search by kanji character
- Search by meaning (English)
- Search by on-readings (音読み)
- Search by kun-readings (訓読み)

- Displays meaning and JLPT level
- Color-coded JLPT levels (N5=Green → N1=Red)
- SRS progress icons (from School to Fire)

#### 4. Detailed Kanji View

- On-readings and Kun-readings sections
- Stroke count and school grade
- Action buttons (Study, Get Mnemonic)

#### 5. SRS Integration
- Progress tracking per user per kanji
- SRS level calculation and display
- Review due date management
- Accuracy tracking (correct/incorrect counts)

#### 6. AI Integration
- ChatGPT mnemonic generation
- Contextual learning assistance

### 🎨 UI/UX Features
- Material Design theming with Dark Midnight theme
- Japanese font support for proper character rendering
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Keyboard shortcuts (F2 for navigation, Ctrl+F for search, etc.)
- Loading states and error handling

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Data Flow
```
DatabaseService → KanjiViewModel → KanjiDisplayModel → XAML Binding
```

#### Key Components
1. **KanjiDisplayModel.cs**: Unified data model
2. **KanjiViewModel.cs**: Business logic and state management  
3. **KanjiView.xaml**: UI layout and binding
4. **Theme Resources**: Color scheme and styling
5. **Converters**: JLPT level colors, SRS level icons

#### Computed Properties
- `LearnedCount`: `KanjiList.Count(k => k.SRSLevel > 2)`
- `ReviewDueCount`: `KanjiList.Count(k => k.IsReviewDue)`
- `TotalKanjiCount`: `KanjiList.Count`

### 🚀 Integration
- Added to MainWindow view routing system
- Integrated with navigation (F2 keyboard shortcut)
- Updated ViewNotImplementedConverter to mark as implemented
- Proper dependency injection setup in App.xaml.cs

### 🎯 User Experience
1. **Navigation**: User presses F2 or clicks "Kanji" in menu
2. **Discovery**: Browse kanji by JLPT level with statistics overview
3. **Search**: Find specific kanji using multiple search criteria
4. **Study**: Select kanji to view detailed information
5. **Practice**: Use Study button to practice and update SRS progress
6. **Learn**: Get AI-generated mnemonics for memory aids

The implementation follows the same high-quality pattern established in the DashboardView and provides a complete, production-ready kanji learning experience.
